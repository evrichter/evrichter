## Hi there 👋 I'm Eva

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I am currently a **Data Expert Trainee** at Previsionz with an academic background in **Language Science and Technology** from Saarland University.  
During my studies I gained both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in **natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and speech science & technology**, working with a variety of tools and frameworks.  

I broadened my perspective through two exchange semesters — at **Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona)** and **Charles University (Prague)** — where I was exposed to international research and different approaches to computational linguistics.  

As a trainee at the **European Parliament in Brussels**, I worked on the **evaluation of a live speech-to-text and machine translation system**, a strong example of how language technologies can make parliamentary debates more inclusive and accessible.  

Before my master’s, I completed a **B.A. in Linguistics and Translation**, also at Saarland University. There, I explored core areas of linguistics, learned to apply **CAT tools** in translation workflows, and wrote my bachelor’s thesis on the **evaluation of machine translation output** — my first real encounter with AI and language technology.  

Ever since, I have been fascinated by how technology can process complex language and support communication across boundaries. I’m motivated to apply my knowledge and continue growing in the fields of **language, data, and AI**.
