## Hi there 👋 I'm Eva

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I am currently based in Saarbrücken and working as a Data Expert Trainee at Previsionz. I obtained my Master's in Language Science and Technology from Saarland University. During my studies I gained both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, psycholinguistics, and speech technology.
I also completed two exchange semesters — at Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona) and Charles University (Prague) — where I not only deepened my academic skills in NLP but also broadened my perspective by experiencing new cultures and languages.  

Moreover, as a trainee at the European Parliament in Brussels, I worked on the evaluation of a live speech-to-text and machine translation system, highlighting the role of language technologies in making parliamentary debates more inclusive.  

Before my master’s, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Linguistics and Translation from Saarland University, where I studied core areas of linguistics, learned to apply CAT tools in translation workflows, and gained my first exposure to AI and language technology through my bachelor’s thesis on the evaluation of machine translation output.

Ever since, I have been fascinated by how technology can process complex language and support communication and I am motivated to apply my knowledge and continue growing in the fields of language, data, and AI.
